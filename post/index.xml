      <title>Scissor Skills</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So it’s been a while since there was a new CanDo blog post, and that’s because it’s been busy over here! Quite a few new referrals, which is nice, but I’ve also just finished (and passed with a distinction!) my research module for my Master’s degree in Advanced Occupational Therapy, which has taken up a lot of my free time. My essay for this module focused on the ethics of conducting research with children, and my dissertation is likely to be a systematic review focusing on fine motor skills interventions with children, so a blog post looking at scissor skills seemed apt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cutting is a skill that most children start to acquire around the age of 3 years, and it tends to follow a similar developmental pathway as pencil use, maturing fully around the age of 6 years. The order in which you can expect your child to develop their cutting skills is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2-3 years: shows an interest in using scissors. Can snip with scissors, often randomly along the edges of paper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-4 years: cuts properly with scissors along a straight line. Closer to 4 years can cut inaccurately around a circle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4-5 years: uses scissors to cut out a triangle, square or other simple shape along the lines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5-6 years: cuts around more complex shapes with increasing accuracy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your child’s thumb should be in the top loop of the scissors, with the scissors held in their dominant hand and the paper in their non-dominant hand. The paper should also be held so that their thumb is on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your child is struggling to use scissors and all of their other fine motor skills seem on track, don’t worry! Every child acquires skills at different rates and the norm covers a broad range. You can develop younger children’s interest in using scissors by tearing paper, and showing them how to snip to make funny textures along the edges. If older children are lacking interest, again it is probably completely normal and most likely related to laziness or frustration when it goes wrong. Encourage them to go slowly with complex shapes and to make small snips rather than big cuts to get the job done quicker! Making cutting part of a bigger overall craft task also helps, and has the added bonus of working on other fine motor skills at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be posting some free cutting craft activities on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cando-ot.com/resources&#34;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; section of this website as I create them so keep checking back – the first is up now!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Returning to work after brain injury</title>
      <link>http://www.cando-ot.com/post/returning-to-work/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our second blog post is going to focus on returning to work after mild to moderate brain injury. Now obviously return to work happens at different times depending on the severity of the brain injury, and the time elapsed since the original injury. But generally speaking, the process itself and the things you need to consider before returning to work are fairly similar. Sometimes return to paid employment is not possible at all, and in those cases it is can be beneficial to try and find another meaningful and productive activity that you or your loved one can engage in, in place of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and most important thing that you need to do is to inform your employer that you have experienced a brain injury. Keeping in touch during the recovery period can help to foster your employer’s understanding of your injury and potential difficulties that you may face on your return to work. There may be opportunities for you to visit your workplace in a non-working capacity for meetings with your employer, and this can help to de-stigmatise your injury for others, and reduce your personal anxiety about physically returning to the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As occupational therapists, the process that we would employ when considering your return to work is to break down the components of the job that you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look at the physical demands placed upon you – do you spend the majority of your day standing or seated? Do you have any lifting to do? Is there a requirement for advanced motor skills, for example, those required to operate heavy machinery or production lines?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also look at the cognitive demands of the job. Is there a need for sustained concentration, or adaptive concentration where you need to be able to switch tasks quickly and effectively, such as when working as a teacher or childcare worker? Is there a requirement for you to have fast and accurate information processing, such as in accountancy or a reception job where you are directing people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consider social and communication skills, particularly in the context of brain injury. Do you need to communicate with individuals face to face, over the telephone, in writing? Is there a need for you to have advanced communication skills, such as those required when discussing a complex problem, for example, as an engineer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would analyse every element of the job that you do and then consider these in the context of your brain injury, in order to establish what rehabilitation, grading or adjustment is required to get you back to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of adjustments to paid work, there are many that can be made. In some cases, return to work is just not possible, particularly if you are in a job where the lasting effects of your brain injury could cause harm to others. An example of this would be as a heavy goods vehicle operator. But in most cases of mild brain injury, graded return to work is an option, as are reasonable adjustments such as more frequent rest breaks, or adaptation to the specific activities that your job includes. Rehabilitation can help here whilst the adjustments are being made – your occupational therapist can identify the specific area of the task that you are struggling with, and work with you to improve the motor or cognitive skill associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to work can be challenging in the early stages, but generally rewarding and extremely beneficial to the recovery process in the long term. Indeed, many of the issues seen after mild brain injury, in particular, are compounded by a lack of productive occupation and structure in an individual’s day. Work gives us that chance to be productive, it encourages a regular routine, and it provides opportunities for social communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headway is a great charitable organisation that supports individuals after brain injury. Some links to relevant areas of their website follows. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Welcome to CanDo</title>
      <link>http://www.cando-ot.com/post/resource/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2016 20:22:46 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, and welcome to CanDo Occupational Therapy’s blog! Carolyn and I are aiming to make this website somewhere that people can come for free advice and ideas on how to help their loved one, as well as a place where you can find out about what services CanDo can offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to start the blog off, I thought I’d post a little activity that parents can do with their children that will help to develop their fine motor function in readiness for writing and other important school skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need is a colander and some pipe cleaners. I cut them in half so that they don’t bend when they are placed, and they are a little easier to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/colander.png&#34; alt=&#34;Colander&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This activity is a great precursor to threading, which can be a difficult skill for little ones to master, especially if their motor skills are already delayed. Picking up the pipe cleaners helps to develop a pincer grasp, and strengthens the tiny muscles in the hand that are used for writing later on. It’s also good for concentration, learning colours, and hand eye coordination. You can even build counting in to it for older children. You can make the activity more difficult by making the pipe cleaners even shorter, and posting them through the holes of the colander.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short and sweet activity for the first post, but expect more from CanDo very soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clare&lt;/p&gt;
